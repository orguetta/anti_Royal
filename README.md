## Catch the malware your EDR is missing!

## Features
EDR is great, but it should not be your magic bullet!
Ransomware groups like Conti and Royal utilize partially encrypted files in order to deploy their malware.
Many EDR will ignore this, and some will ignore file sizes.
This can allow bad actors to deploy their malware on to your network and systems.
